## Reflection Document

### HTML

This exercise was pretty easy to understand once I was more comfortable using bootstrap. Some things I was unable to figure out at first, but I looked through the slides and utilized the internet and it was fine.

### Accessibility

All of these were accessible. I got one warning about header structure, but I think this should be fine.
