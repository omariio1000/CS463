## Reflection Document

### HTML

This exercise was relatively straightforward. One thing I had trouble with at first was figuring out the syntax for the `grid-template-areas` but once I figured it out it was easy from there.

### Accessibility

All of these were accessible. I got one warning  about missing an `<h1>` header, and another about no header structure. but I think this should be fine.
