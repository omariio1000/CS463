## Reflection Document

### HTML

This exercise was interesting. I'm not a huge fan of JQuery but that may be just because I'm not too used to it yet. I'm sure that I'll get better with it the more I use it.

### Accessibility

All of these were accessible. I got warnings about skipping header levels, but I think this should be fine.
