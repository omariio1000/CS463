## Reflection Document

### HTML

This exercise was pretty easy to understand once I figured out one issue. The flex item didn't have any css styling, so I had to add that before I started working on the responses. After that it was smooth sailing.

### Accessibility

All of these were accessible. I got one error about missing an `<h1>` header, but I think this should be fine.
