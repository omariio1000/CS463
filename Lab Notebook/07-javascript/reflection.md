## Reflection Document

### HTML

This exercise was a bit harder than the rest. I'm not as comfortable with JavaScript yet, and there's some where I had to go check the solutions for the samples. I think that I'm getting more familiar with it, but it may still take some practice.

### Accessibility

All of these were accessible. I got warnings about skipping header levels, but I think this should be fine.
