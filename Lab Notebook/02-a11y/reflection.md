## Reflection Document

### HTML

This exercise was pretty simple to implement after attending the lecture and viewing the slides. I had to search up the fieldset, and one thing that I wish I could change is how the fieldset box goes across the whole screen, I want it to just cover the radio buttons.

### Accessibility

Everything here was accessible, and I got no errors from Wave. It is relatively simple and straighforward.
