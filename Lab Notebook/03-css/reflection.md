## Reflection Document

### HTML

These exercises were straightforward to implement based on the content in class and the slides. I was a little confused at first with the media queries, but I figured it out by looking at examples and it was pretty esasy from there.

### Accessibility

All of these were accessible. I got one error about missing an `<h1>` header, but I think this should be fine.
