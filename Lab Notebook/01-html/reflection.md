## Reflection Document

### HTML

Most of these exercises were relatively simple and easy to implement after viewing the slides. The one exercise I had to look up was the last one for the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements. This one was good because it taught me how to find good resources online. One issue that I have is that the images from [Place Kitten](placektten.com) and [Place Puppy](place-puppy.com) weren't loading at the time of the exercise. I think I did them right, but will have to wait and see. 

### Accessibility

Everything here was accessible, except that I kept getting an error from Wave AIM that my website was missing a header. I could add one, but this is not within the scope of the exercises (I think).
